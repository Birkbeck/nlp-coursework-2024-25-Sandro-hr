The Flesch Kinkaid score is a metric used to assess the complexity of a text, 
by looking at the average words per sentence and the average syllables 
per word. Although it can be a useful metric, its score can lead to inaccuacies by
not taking into account target audience, grammar, punctuation, writing style or overall structure.

This is best exemplified in two situations.  A text might explain a complex topic 
using short sentences and simple words, leading to a low score; however, readers 
unfamiliar with certain terminology may still find it difficult to understand. On 
the other hand, we could have a text that is simple in nature but, the use of longer 
words and sentences leads to a higher score.

These are the main two situations in which the Flesch Kinkaid score can lead to 
inaccuracies when assessing text complexity.
